Project: NeRF or Nothing
Status Update 1

1) This Week:
This week, most of the focus is on deepening the research on Neural Radiance Fields as
through multiple website and Github repository to see which one best works for our
project. In addition, I also had to learn how this whole concept works in order to
understand how different code works. Many candidates includes COLMAP, SLAM and ORB-SLAM.
Upon researching, COLMAP works the best but it is build upon C++, while our API works with
Python. Thus, I need to find Python binding for COLMAP so that it will work with this
project. I have successfully downloaded COLMAP on my computer and is currently playing
with the interface to see how it works by inputting images. This process is close to
working but not quite yet. My main task will be on writing functions to scrape codes from
the COLMAP repo and implementing the code into this project.


2) Next Week:
Next week, I hope to start writing scripts that allows the transition between C++ version
COLMAP and the python version of COLMAP. After getting COLMAP successfully to work with
python, hopefully, I hope to start writing script functions in the workflow that uses the
GitHub API to allow for the case statements. I also need to future research this topic
next week to get a deeper understanding.


3) Blockers:
There are currently no technical blockers.
