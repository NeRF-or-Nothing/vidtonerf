# Installing Flask

### Honestly this will probably work for any OS, although you **should** know what command runs python.
### If you're unsure, run 
```sh
where python
``` 
### or 
```sh 
which python
```
### in a terminal.
### If there aren't any results or there's an error, try those two commands with "python3" as the argument instead. (These commands are Unix-like but I believe "which" works in Windows.)
</br>

### Then, install flask 
###
```sh
python -m pip install flask
```
</br>
