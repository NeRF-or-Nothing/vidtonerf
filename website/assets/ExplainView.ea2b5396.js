This technology is rapidly developing, and it may be the best path forwards to photorealistic rendering of viewpoints never before seen before by a camera. Many large research labs like Facebook AI and Google research are pursuing this technology in order to render realistic simulations for self-driving cars and to improve the usability of 3D scans. Our project, NeRF or Nothing, will be a web application based on this technology that allows people to input videos or collections of photos and render novel realistic views of the scene they captured. This will include the ability for users to create \u201Cflythroughs\u201D or move virtual cameras through scene\u2019s they have captured to create videos from unseen perspectives.
